# DNS-Security
Comparison of DNS, DNS Sec and DNS crypt

Usage:
>>python dnsserver.py<br/>
python dnsclient.py www.google.com


#DNS_SEC
python dnsserver.py<br/>
python dnsclient.py www.cloudflare.com

Note that we need to add IP addresses for these addresses. Somehow, www.google.com returned empty response for DNSKEY when dnssec was set to true.
